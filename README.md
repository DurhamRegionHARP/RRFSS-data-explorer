# RRFSS Data Explorer

Host, edit, and visualize CSV data using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/).

This application uses the City of Philadelphia [Community Health Explorer](https://healthexplorer.phila.gov) and the [Web Experience Toolkit](https://wet-boew.github.io) (WET-BOEW) as a framework. We appreciate the combined effort of the contributors to each of these projects. :clap: :smiley:

## What is it?

The RRFSS Data Explorer is a tool that letâ€™s you explore data on health behaviours, knowledge and attitudes among Durham Region residents. The data is collected using the Rapid Risk Factor Surveillance System (RRFSS), which is a phone survey of adults age 18+ who live in Durham Region. RRFSS collects information on a variety of health topics such as tobacco and alcohol use, active transportation, screen time use, nutrition, flu immunization, public health inspections, awareness of Lyme disease, and much more. It is intended to provide an easy way to access and visualize all of the information collected in the RRFSS survey. This tool allows you examine the RRFSS data by demographic information of the survey respondents, by their gender, age group, income level, education and municipality which they live in.
