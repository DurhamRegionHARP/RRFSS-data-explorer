## What is the RRFSS Data Explorer?

The RRFSS Data Explorer is a tool that lets you view data on health behaviours, knowledge, and attitudes among Durham Region residents. The Rapid Risk Factor Surveillance System (RRFSS) is a phone survey of Ontario adults age 18 and older. RRFSS collects information on health behaviours, health conditions, and social and environmental determinants of health. The Data Explorer provides an easy way to access and visualize important information collected in RRFSS. The tool shows information across five categories: age, gender, income, municipality and trends over time. This way, you can see public health challenges that exist between groups of people.
